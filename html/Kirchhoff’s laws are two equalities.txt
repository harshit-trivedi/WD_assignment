Kirchhoff’s laws are two equalities that deal with the current and voltage in electrical circuits. They were first described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. They are based on the principles of conservation of energy and charge. Kirchhoff’s current law states that the sum of currents flowing into and out of a node is zero. Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the sum of voltages around a loop is zero1.

To apply Kirchhoff’s laws to analyze a simple electric circuit, you can follow these steps2:

Identify all the loops in the circuit.
Assign a direction for each loop.
Assign a current for each loop.
Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to each loop.
Solve the resulting system of equations.
